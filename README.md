# DubTrack4J
A Java API for Dubtrack.

## THIS IS A PROTOTYPE, NONE OF THE CODE HERE IS FINAL OR COMPLETE
I do not reccomend that you start using this as of yet.
Infact, a good amount of this code is laziness with the aim of getting things working instead of good code.

### TODO
- Stop using Jsoup
- Add layers of abstraction
- Clean up code
- Add support for events & features
